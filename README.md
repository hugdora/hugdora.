# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugdora/">Huguette Dora Edjangue</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

Cybersecurity excites me because it is where technology, risk, and real-world problem-solving meet. I love diving into hands-on projects that involve everything from vulnerability management to cloud security governance and threat detection. Each project helps me explore new ways to improve security posture, streamline compliance, and protect what matters most.
I invite you to take a look at my work and see how I have applied these principles in practice.
